# Severity-of-US-Accidents-Prediction
Severity of US Accidents Predictionâ€“ US countrywide traffic accident (2016-20)

a. Developed single-model to perform predictions on kaggle US countrywide accidents dataset.

b. Developed single model to perform predictions on 5 states of US(CA,VA,OK,MO,KS) representing east, west, north and south regions using only kaggle US countrywide accidents dataset.

c. Developed single model to perform predictions on 5 states of US(CA,VA,OK,MO,KS) using both kaggle US countrywide accidents plus US demographic dataset.

d. Developed multiple model to perform predictions on 5 states of US(CA,VA,OK,MO,KS) separately using both kaggle US countrywide accidents plus US demographic dataset.

e. I chose to use sklearn libraries such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression for developing models.
